This repository now contains a small static resume website at `resume-site/`.

How to view
- Open `resume-site/index.html` in your browser.
- Replace placeholder text and `resume.pdf` with your actual resume file.

Deployment
- To host on GitHub Pages, move the files to the repository root or enable Pages for `/resume-site`.

If you'd like a more elaborate version (contact form, dynamic JSON-based resume, or a PDF generator), tell me which features you want and I can extend it.
